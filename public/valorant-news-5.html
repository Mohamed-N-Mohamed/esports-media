              <h5 class="bold">Fnatic sign Derke and Magnum, complete VALORANT roster again</h5>
              <p>As Fnatic released two of their former players, they brought in two new ones to complete their VALORANT
                roster once more.
              </p>

              <img src="./img/FNC-release-Moe-from-VALORANT-roster-720x405.jpg" alt="">

              <p>After releasing two of their players in the form of Kostas “tsack” Theodoropoulos and Muhammad “Moe40”
                Hariff following mediocre results in the past months, Fnatic went looking to once again complete their
                roster. After rumors of CS:GO veteran Olofmeister joining, they eventually signed Nikita “Derke”
                Sirmitev and Martin “Magnum” Penkov to the roster.</p>

              <p>Derke has been regarded as a top talent in VALORANT at only 18 years old, as he also has a minor
                history within CS:GO. Magnum, a Czech player, on the other hand has been proving his worth as a VALORANT
                player for quite a while now and was one of the top players that was still looking to be picked up by a
                major organization. The pair will join up with Jake “Boaster” Howlett, Domagoj “Doma” Fancev and James
                “Mistic” Orfila.</p>


              <p>Things have been rough for Fnatic, but they hope their recent signings and changes will give them the
                push they need to be competitive at the top level. “Our vision for Fnatic VALORANT remains the same now
                as it will be in the future: to challenge at the very top, and compete for the biggest titles that the
                game has to offer.“</p>
