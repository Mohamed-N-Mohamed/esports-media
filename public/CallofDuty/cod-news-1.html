              <p>Raven Software updated the Verdansk BR Playlist to no longer include the Most Wanted contract, after a powerful glitch surfaced.
              </p>


              <img src="../img/Warzone-contract-Most-Wanted-689x405.jpg" alt="">
              <p>The developer was quick to react to this new bug, and included it on their Trello page immediately, indicating they’re working on a fix.</p>

              <p>For a still unknown reason, the Most Wanted contracts allowed players to get into a God mode, becoming invincible. Because of the severity of the bug, the quick fix was to disable the contract altogether.</p>

              <p>Despite the fast response on this bug, there are unfortunately quite a few bugs and glitches that plague the Battle Royale. The infinite stim glitch, where players can heal constantly in the ring while taking damage, is one of the more known ones.</p>

              <p>People on Twitter were quick to point out all the other things they felt should be fixed with the same urgency as the Most Wanted contract bug, ranging from nerfing guns to increasing the variety in settings for console players.</p>

              <p>Luckily for players, there are still enough other contracts that are available to collect loot and cash.</p>

              <p>The next season of Warzone starts next week on April 21st. In order to get people to play during the final weekend of the current season (season 2), the “Triple Double XP” event went live. This should allow players to finish their battle pass progression in time for the new season.</p>

              <p>Season 3 should see some updates on the map, as Activision has been teasing big changes over the past few weeks.</p>
