              <p>Day one of the Blast Premier Spring Showdown started with a bang as both Astralis and Team Liquid were
                upset early on.
              </p>


              <img src="./img/f0rest-DIG-720x405.jpg" alt="PentaKill LCS Opening Ceremony">

              <p> Starting off with the first 0-2 of the day, OG’s new and improved roster got an ideal start by
                defeating Astralis. Starting on Inferno, Valdemar “valde” Vangsa had an incredible game against his
                Danish counterparts, his 26 kills and 115 ADR facilitating OG’s 16-7 victory. Astalis finally subbed in
                their almost constant benchwarmer, Lucas “Bubzkji” but to little effect as they quickly put Andreas
                “Xyp9x” Hojsleth back in.</p>

              <p>Astralis certainly had a better game on Dust2, but ultimately met the same result. OG’s IGL, Aleksi
                “Aleksib” Virolainen, led the OT win (17-19) with 27 total frags. Knocking out Astralis this early and
                with two new official members certainly bodes well for OG’s BLAST run.</p>



              <p>G2 faced off against their EPL groupmate, Endpoint, and redeemed themselves with a relatively
                comfortable 2-0. In game one on Inferno, Kia “Surreal” Man, despite his team’s loss, had an impeccable
                game as he found 32 kills and 107 ADR. The combined efforts of G2 managed to overcome the outstanding
                invidiual performances from Endpoint however and resulted in a 16-14 win.</p>

              <p>Dust2 was significantly better for G2, though trailing at the half (7-8) G2 had a much beter CT-side
                and secured a 6 round streak that put themselves firmly in the lead. One of G2’s most recent performing
                members, Nemanja “huNter-” Kovac once again had a topfrag performance.</p>

              <p>Perhaps the biggest shock of the day, Dignitas’ new roster similarly swept Team Liquid. Absolutely
                rolling on their map pick, Nuke, Dignitas claimed a 16-5 victory. Vertigo was a much closer affair for
                Team Liquid, though were left with a deficit at the end of both halves</p>

              <p>Dignitas’ most recent pickup, Jonas “Lekr0” Olofsson, showed exactly why Dignitas prioritizng picking
                him up as ended thee series with 47 total frags and an impressie 104 ADR. </p>
